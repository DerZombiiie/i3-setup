# i3-setup
My personal i3-gaps setup for  Ubuntu.

Installs zsh, oh-my-zsh, kitty, i3-gaps, picom, feh, lua, batcat, lolcat, cowsay, fortune.
Includes a custom zsh theme, wallpaper, kitty configuration, i3-gaps configuration, and a custom cat program written in lua.

This works perfectly fine when installing it on an already fully set up desktop environment (like KDE Plasma) without affecting the already installed environment; however it will nuke your zshrc.
You should probably install ssdm unless you already have a different desktop environment installed. In this case, run you can run the install_additional.sh script to install sddm as well as additional desktop programs like ark, okular and firefox.
